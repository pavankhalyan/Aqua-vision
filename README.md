• In Paralympic specifically in swimming events, blind swimmers depend on human "Tappers" who stand nearby on the end of the poolside and use a one-long pole to tap the swimmers to signal when to turn and finish.  ​

• This method can affect the swimmer’s performance, so our idea is to replace the system with a sensors and give them a live statistics, which they fitted with the belt and cap. ​

• When swimmers approach the wall, an ultrasonic sensor detects with a certain distance of approach giving an alert in the cap and when they are out of track message is given in the belt.
giveing the solution to the blind swimmers 

//just assume that he is blind swimmer and he is wearing that swimming cap which is integrated with the sensors and microcontroller. 

hardwares: 
-> ATTINY - PCB DESIGN 
-> LORA MODULE(Bluetooth)
-> JSN_SR04T(underwater ultrasonic sensor)
-> Erm coin vibrator (indicator). 

Software Requirements: 

-> Arduino IDE
-> MERN Stack
-> AWS (cloud)
